### Explore US Bikeshare Data

#### Description
This project is about exploring US bikeshare data of three cities namely Chicago, New York and Washington interactively. By interactively I mean that user can interact
with the system from CLI. He can choose the city he want to explore and can apply filters all right from the terminal itself. It will display
basic stats like frequent travel time, trip duration stats, etc. A user can also look at the raw data on demand.

#### Libraries Used
Following are the libraries that go behind the working of this project:
* [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/): pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
* [**numpy**](https://numpy.org/): NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* **pprint**: to pretty print the raw data

#### Files used
Following are the three files used for this project:
* Chicago bikeshare data
* New York bikeshare data
* Washington bikeshare data

The data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

#### Credits
This project is created as part of Udacity's Nanodegree program.
Apart from the Udacity program content, I took help some tutorials on youtube about date manipulation and finding some basic stats using pandas:
* [How do I work with dates and times in pandas?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCgJGsg0Xa4) by Data School
* [Working with Dates and Time Series Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuo7EHI8zc) by Corey Schafer
